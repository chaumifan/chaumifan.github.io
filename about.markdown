I'm Kevin Chau. Trying to navigate through life while sharing things I like.
My hobbies include:
* volleyball - prefer indoor > grass > sand but suck at them all
* bouldering - highest grade is V7 but more like a V4-V5 climber
* anime/manga - I follow the weekly Shounen Jump
* finding awesome restaurants - check out my [Map Guides](/map-guides/)!
* video games - Super Smash Bros Melee, URF in League

You can email me at [kevinmingchau[at]gmail[dot]com](mailto:kevinmingchau@gmail.com).
