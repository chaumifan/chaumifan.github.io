I finally got around to setting up my own website after failing a couple of
times previously due to Ruby dependencies on Windows and on a Linux VM. Now I'm
finally on a MacOS so I might as well try for the third time before forever
cursing Ruby and my stubborness to not use a site generator instead.

Once everything was setup, adding pages and posts seems easy enough at least.
I've gone ahead and added all my current map guides, but some are still a WIP.
I'll eventually think of some more things to throw on here but for now I think
this is a good start.

P.S. if anyone knows how to ignore hard-wrap line breaks for posts, I would
appreciate it if you would let me know. My Google skills suck apparently.
